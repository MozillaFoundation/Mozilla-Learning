            Mozilla Foundation (“Mozilla” or “Sponsor”) is a global non-profit organization with a mission to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web. With support from the United States National Science Foundation (“NSF”), Mozilla presents this Gigabit Community Fund (the “Fund”) to help foster and support the development of applications and associated curricula running on next-generation networks that could improve people’s everyday lives through creating new education and workforce development opportunities. Proposals submitted to the Gigabit Community Fund may be based on projects funded in the separate Mozilla Ignite Challenge conducted prior to this Gigabit Community Fund, building off existing ideas and funding, or may be based entirely on new ideas (“Submissions”).

            <p>
            Participation is open to companies, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations (each an “Applicant”). References in this document to “you” shall refer to Applicant. Funding will not be granted to unaffiliated individuals acting on their own. Each Applicant must include at least one affiliated organization located in the Austin, TX, Chattanooga, TN, or Kansas City, MO, metropolitan region. Employees of Mozilla, NSF, and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and their immediate families and people living in their households may not participate. Fund evaluators review Submissions. Fund evaluators shall not evaluate or review any Submission to which they have a direct connection, whether through employ, affiliation, partnership or other contractual obligation or relational context that creates the consensus amongst the Fund evaluators of a conflict of interest. Sponsor, at its sole discretion, shall determine eligibility of any individual or entity, and may disqualify any Applicant or individual participant at any time for any reason.
            </p>
            <p>
            The person making the Submission on behalf of an Applicant (the “Lead Contact”) must: (a) be at least 18 years of age; (b) identify himself or herself by name as Lead Contact and provide the names of all individuals or organizations participating in developing the proposal; (c) certify that he or she has the right to act on behalf of the Applicant; (d) agree to these Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) on behalf of the Applicant, and (e) be a legal resident or citizen of the United States or hold a lawfully issued student visa, work permit, or other documentation entitling the Lead Contact to work or receive compensation for work in the United States.

            <p>
            Registration and Submissions will be accepted during the submission period via the Fund website. All registrations and Submissions must be in English. By registering and providing an email address, Applicant agrees to receive email communications from Sponsor related to the Fund.
            </p>
            <p>
            All sections of the registration and submission forms must be completed to be considered for the Fund. All Submissions are final upon upload to the Fund website.
            </p>
            <p>
            No more than three Submissions are permitted from each Applicant. Any subsequent Submissions from the same Applicant will not be considered. In the event of a dispute over the identity of an Applicant, he/she will be deemed to be the account holder of the email account associated with that person during the registration and submission process on the Fund website. In the event two or more Submissions describe substantially similar projects, the evaluator’s determination of the qualitatively superior proposal will determine which Submission is considered.
            </p>
            <p>
            No responsibility is assumed for lost, late, incomplete, invalid, illegible, incorrect, inaccurate or misdirected registrations or Submissions; or for any error, human, technical or otherwise that may occur in the processing of Submissions.
