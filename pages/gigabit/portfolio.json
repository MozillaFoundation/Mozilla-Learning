    "Project Summary": "SensED is a project-based social innovation program for 7-12 graders to highlight and provide real-world experiences in the emerging field of Internet of Things. The project will (1) create a mapped curriculum for middle and high school students, (2) train teachers through a series of professional development modules over the summer, (3) provide a stronger platfrom to launch an expanded version of the program in the fall that has increased capacity to support teams throughout the metro area, broader impact, and greater potential for scale.",
    "Outcomes": "This project pilot period concludes in late 2016.",
    "Gigabit Advantage": "Last year, the Kansas City Council approved a $15 million agreement with Cisco Systems Inc. to turn a two- mile stretch of the streetcar line into a “Smart City” network. Part of being “smart” is utilizing information and communications technology and the Internet to address urban challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT) allows us to connect people, processes, data and things in order to improve the quality and livability of cities, communities, buildings and more. SensED brings IoT understanding and know how to middle and high school students across the Kansas City metropolitan area and supports them in using those technologies to innovate solutions for everyday problems.",

    "Project Summary": "PlanIT Impact is putting its big data   3D modeling technology in the hands of students in Kansas City to advance education around sustainable design. Summer semester architecture students at the Kansas City Design Center will apply PlanIT Impact to their studio projects to understand resource impact modules of energy usage, water usage and storm water perviousness. The PlanIT Impact development team will also be working contiguously to develop additional modules of Building Density, which require a more intensive collaboration with Kansas City, MO’s parcel data and Open Data portal. As these additional resource impact modules become available, students will have access to test them and record their outputs.",
    "Outcomes": "This project pilot period concludes in late 2016.  This project was demoed at the 2016 US Ignite Summit in Austin, TX.",
    "Gigabit Advantage": "There is an extraordinary amount of data being transferred in this project application, including 3D digital architectural models and GIS models as well as national and local Open Data API data translation. The project team is hoping to show how the reduction in time for upload and feedback of metrics will increase ease of iteration and more in-depth study of potential performance. The hope is that the project will lead to the design of a novel distributed software architecture that leverages the power of cloud computing and gigabit networking to advance the state-of-the-art in design and planning. The project can be replicated to other communities as well due to ubiquity of cloud computing and increasing availability of Open Data and gigabit networking across cities in the US.",
