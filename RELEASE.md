## Release Process

This documents the process for issuing and deploying a new
release for teach.mozilla.org.

It assumes the following:

  * You want to create release `0.0.4`.
  * Your GitHub username is `toolness`.

If this isn't the case, simply replace these values for your own.
And if you want to make things a lot easier, you can generate a custom
version of this document by running:

```
node lib/changelog.js release 0.0.4 toolness
```

These instructions also assume that your `develop` branch currently
contains the changes you want to release.

After running this `changelog release` command, run through the following steps:

1.  Verify that the ["Unreleased" section of `CHANGELOG.md`][unreleased]
    is up-to-date by comparing it against GitHub's commit list (you can
    see that by clicking on the "Unreleased" section heading), and then
    describe the changes in a human-meaningful form (see previous release
    entries for the appropriate level of human-friendliness).

    Feel free to move more important, less technical entries to the top
    of the list. Remember, it will be read by both developers *and* users,
    so avoid the use of jargon where possible.

2.  Create a branch off your `develop` called `v0.0.4-rc` and push it to
    your GitHub fork:

    ```
    git checkout -b v0.0.4-rc develop
    git push -u https://github.com/toolness/teach.mozilla.org.git v0.0.4-rc
    ```

3.  [Issue a PR][pr] to merge your branch into `master` titled
    "Tag and release v0.0.4". Paste in the latest changes from the
    topmost "Unreleased" section of `CHANGELOG.md` into the
    description of the PR so stakeholders know what's changed. If you're
    on OS X, you can easily copy this to your clipboard with the following
    command:

    ```
    node lib/changelog.js unreleased | pbcopy
    ```

    If you're on Windows, just use `clip` instead of `pbcopy`.

4.  Make sure that Travis thinks the PR looks good (i.e., all tests pass).

5.  Wait for the stakeholders to sign-off on the release. Usually this just
    means @hannahkane, but if she's not around, consider asking
    @ldecoursy instead.

6.  Update the version number in `package.json` to `0.0.4` and then
    run:

    ```
    node lib/changelog.js bump
    ```

    This will create a new entry for the new version in `CHANGELOG.md`,
    and it will also output your new version's release notes to
    `tag-message-v0.0.4.txt`.

7.  Commit the changes to git and push them:

    ```
    git commit -a -m "Release v0.0.4."
    git push
    ```

8.  Merge the PR into `master`. Once Travis CI is finished, the site
    will be deployed to production.

9.  Tag the release and push it to the official repository:

    ```
    git tag -a v0.0.4 -F tag-message-v0.0.4.txt
    git push https://github.com/mozilla/teach.mozilla.org.git v0.0.4   
    ```

10. Merge `v0.0.4-rc` into `develop` on the official repository:

    ```
    git checkout develop
    git pull https://github.com/mozilla/teach.mozilla.org.git develop
    git merge v0.0.4-rc
    git push https://github.com/mozilla/teach.mozilla.org.git develop
    ```

Hooray, you're done!
